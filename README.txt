Board Game originally called Camp Drunk-A-Lot
Players move around the board rolling a 6 sided die, when they land on a square they must either face a challenge of complete a task. On tasks they must roll all their dice and roll less than the total roll of the dice that is shown in the board space, and if they succeed they add another die to the ones they already have. On challenge spaces the player must beat the dice roll that is listed in the space, and on success they gain one point. When enough points are achieved the player may them move to the inner loop which is similar but with higher points and more dice. When the player gets enough points in the inner loop they may attempt to enter the winners space and face one last challenge.
